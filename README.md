# PyBer_Analysis
## 1. Overview
The main purpose of this analysis is to compare the weekly fares of three different types of city in order to get a better understanding of the market behavior

## 2. Results
###### ***Figure 1.*** Ride sharing summary

It is shown in ***Figure 1*** that the Urban type represents the majority of the fares amount for the company, however, as the number of urban drivers is huge, the average fare per driver is the lowest one.

###### Figure 2. Multiple line chart of total fares

***Figure 2*** shows that the weekly amount of urban fares remains at the top on every week. Followed by the sub urban, and finally, the rural.
The lowest amount of urban fares is at the begining of the year, as also is shown inthe suburban type. The rural amount of fares remains very similar during the whole period of time.


###### Figure 3. Average fare according to number of rides per type of city

***Figure 3*** shows that the little amount of rural drivers impacts directly in the average fare. However, as the amount of rides is also very low the fare has to compensate somehow in order to be attractive for the drivers.

## 3. Summary (Business recommendations)
  - To remove the rural rides, since is only the 4.2% of the total profits and intensify the presence in the urban zones.
  - To create a program for economic motivations in order to increase the number of drivers in rural areas
  - To limit the number of drivers per area to control the decreasing of urban fares
